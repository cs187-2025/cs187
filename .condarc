# CS187 Materials - Local Conda Configuration
# This file automatically configures conda to use reliable channels
# when working in the CS187 Materials directory.
#
# Students can use any conda distribution (Anaconda, Miniconda, Miniforge)
# and this configuration will ensure packages install correctly.

# Use conda-forge as the primary channel for reliability and completeness
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults  # Fallback for packages not in conda-forge

# Strict channel priority ensures we get packages from conda-forge first
# This prevents mixing packages from different channels which can cause conflicts
channel_priority: strict

# Show progress bars and channel info during installs
show_channel_urls: true
always_yes: false

# Use faster libmamba solver if available (conda 4.12+)
# This significantly speeds up dependency resolution
experimental:
  - jlap
  - lock

# Environment-specific settings
create_default_packages:
  - pip
  - wheel
